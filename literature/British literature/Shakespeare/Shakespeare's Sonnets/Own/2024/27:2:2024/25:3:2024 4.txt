How can one forget those once held dear,
Their place in our hearts, forever near?
Though apart, never meeting eye to eye,
A sacred spot for them will never die.

For those cherished souls we once held close,
Their memory lingers, an eternal rose.
No matter the distance, the silence that grows,
A special place in our hearts, it always shows.

To say "forget" is but a futile claim,
Their presence echoes, a steady flame.
Though paths diverge, and contact is lost,
Their seat in our hearts, forever embossed.

So let their place remain, a cherished space,
A testament to love's enduring grace.
For the ones we held, we'll always treasure,
Their spot in our hearts, an eternal measure.
