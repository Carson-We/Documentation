In love's grand stage, fate did mock at me,
Carson, the one who wore the cuckold's crown,
By a maiden named Kristy, just thirteen,
Betrayed, my heart in sorrow starts to drown.

Oh, cruel jest of love, so unkindly played,
To be adorned with green, a symbol clear,
A cuckold's fate, my honor now betrayed,
With wounded pride, I'm left in deep despair.

But let not this misfortune break my soul,
For love's caprice, a tempest soon will pass,
I'll rise again, my spirit to console,
And find new joy, beyond this bitter glass.

For in the realm of love, we all may fall,
Yet rise again, stronger, standing tall.
