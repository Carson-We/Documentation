As I delve into our chat's memoir,
Tears flow unbidden, my heart left sore.
Hoping to salvage remnants of our past,
Yet realizing, naught can forever last.

In the archive's depths, emotions arise,
A cascade of memories, truth in disguise.
The illusion of preserving what we had,
But in truth, all slips away, good and bad.

Fleeting as shadows, moments slip away,
Leaving empty echoes that silently sway.
No matter how tightly I hold on tight,
Time's relentless grasp steals every sight.

So I weep for what's lost, what cannot stay,
In the realm of words, love finds its own way.
But as I turn the pages, tears may fall,
Yet love's essence endures, beyond recall.
