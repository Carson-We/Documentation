Do I truly vex so much, alas, I ponder?
Yet my vexation is reserved for those dear,
But why does everyone perceive me a bother?

With love and care, I strive to appear,
To shower kindness and warmth, I intend,
But alas, my intentions seem unclear.

Perhaps it is a fault I fail to mend,
Or a misunderstanding that clouds their view,
For in my heart, love's essence I send.

Oh, how I wish they could see the true,
That my vexation stems from love's embrace,
But alas, their perception remains askew.
