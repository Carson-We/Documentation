In hushed whispers, my voice remains unheard,
A muted cry longing to be released,
Concealed emotions, like a caged bird,
Seeking ears that listen, souls truly pleased.
But in this silence, I find my own voice,
Unveiling depths of thoughts with intricate hue,
Words adorned with lexicons that rejoice,
In the beauty of expression, rare and true.
Though lacking audience, my words persist,
Resonating in the chambers of my soul,
Through intricate metaphors, they insist,
To be heard, acknowledged, and made whole.
For in the realm of silence, I still strive,
Hoping one day, my voice will come alive.
