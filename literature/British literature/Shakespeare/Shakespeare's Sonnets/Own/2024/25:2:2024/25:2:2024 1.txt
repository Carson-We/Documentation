In this elongated passage, I am ensnared in longing,
A nostalgic surge that overwhelms and keeps me clinging.
I recall the days we laughed and cried as one,
Every detail vividly etched, in my mind they've spun.

We were carefree, as if never to part,
Sharing our lives, chasing dreams with open heart.
But fate, cruelly, tore us apart,
And led us down separate paths, breaking our start.

Now I can only reminisce through memories' embrace,
Each photo of our shared moments brings tears to my face.
The laughter we had, unable to contain,
Now a distant echo, only in memories to regain.

I think of the places we once walked together,
The secrets we shared, the festivals we'd gather.
Longing weighs upon me, a burden of solitude,
Each pang of longing, like a blade, cuts deep and crude.

Yet, I understand, distance and time can't sever,
The bond of friendship that lingers forever.
Though miles apart, we're always close at heart,
Isn't that true, even though we're physically apart?

Though longing brings me pain, I believe it shall pass,
In this elongated passage, I'm trapped in its morass.
Each day feels like an endless abyss, swallowing me whole,
Longing, a venomous serpent, gripping my soul.

I recall our carefree laughter, now hollow and forlorn,
Seeking solace in details, only to feel more torn.
We were once each other's support, sharing life's embrace,
But now I face this infinite darkness, alone in this space.

Longing, a sharp blade, pierces my heart with strife,
Each agony suffocates, stealing the breath of life.
No matter the distance or the passage of time,
I can't let go of our connection, a bond so sublime.

The weight of loneliness leaves me gasping for air,
Abandoned in this frigid world, beyond repair.
I seek a glimmer of hope, but darkness devours all,
I know these negative emotions won't forever befall.

Yet in this moment, helplessness and despair reside,
Uncertain of the meaning the future will provide.
Perhaps this pain and anguish I must endure,
But I question my strength, if it's enough to ensure.

Silently, I bear it all, with no solace in sight,
Hoping that one day, negativity will take flight.
Leaving behind a flicker of hope, a beacon so bright,
As I navigate this passage, towards a new light.
