Hand-written letters wane, significance lost,
Neglected treasures, in drawers they're tossed.
Few read the romance, the writer's endeavor,
Love's essence hidden, in words they sever.

Penmanship's art fades, screens take hold,
Emotions diminished, in stories untold.
Texts replace the warmth, the intimacy shared,
Connections weakened, meaning impaired.

Oh, the pity of letters now forsaken,
Society moves on, love's essence shaken.
Writer's heart breaks, passion left to decay,
As hand-written letters fade away.
