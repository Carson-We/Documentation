Charging policy:

According to my charging policy, the usage of all term products is as follows:
- Personal, educational and non-commercial use: Free download of personal version.
- Commercial use, team use, or profit from products derived from your own products: You need to pay US$500 per month, obtain a company certificate, and download the company version. The corporate version costs $500 per month. If you forget to pay, for any reason, your access will be suspended until payment is made again. Once payment is confirmed, access will be restored immediately.

All versions are required to prominently feature my name and other identifiable authorship in any derived content.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, please feel free to contact me.
