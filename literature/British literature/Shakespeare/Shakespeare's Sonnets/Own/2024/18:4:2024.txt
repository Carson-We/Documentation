When the moon's soft glow adorns the night's sky,
And stars, like diamonds, twinkle from on high,
A scene of beauty, captivating sight,
Where love's eternal flame takes its flight.

In fair Verona, where two lovers meet,
Their hearts entwined, their souls forever sweet,
A tale of passion, written in the stars,
Their love, a melody that knows no bars.

With sonnets penned, their love forever told,
In sacred verse, where timeless words unfold,
A Shakespearean sonnet, fourteen lines,
Each word a gem, where beauty intertwines.

For in this realm of love and tragedy,
A bard's creation, woven masterfully,
The echoes of his verse, they still remain,
A testament to love's enduring reign.
