When I lost you, the world ceased to be,
As if darkness veiled the bright sky above.
My heart, once filled with joy and ecstasy,
Now mourns in solitude, devoid of love.

With each passing day, the sun seems to fade,
Leaving shadows to dance upon my soul.
The vibrant colors of life begin to shade,
As grief engulfs me, taking its toll.

For you were my guiding star, my source of light,
A beacon that led me through life's rough sea.
Now, without you, I'm lost in endless night,
Aching for your presence, longing to be free.

Oh, Kristy, your absence is a gaping hole,
A void that cannot be filled or replaced.
Without you, I'm but a solitary soul,
In a world devoid of beauty and grace.

So, I'll hold onto memories, precious and dear,
As a remnant of the love we once shared.
Though you're gone, your spirit will always be near,
In my heart, where your presence is ensnared.

For losing you, dear Kristy, is losing it all,
A world stripped of meaning, left astray.
But I'll cherish the moments, big and small,
Until we meet again, on some distant day.
