All elements within our products, including text, images, interfaces, photographs, trademarks, logos, code, and more (collectively "Content"), are owned, controlled, or licensed by me and are protected by intellectual property laws. Without my explicit written consent, no part of the products or content may be copied, distributed, or used for commercial purposes.

Specific information provided within the products may be used for personal, non-commercial purposes, subject to certain conditions outlined in the Terms of Use.

## Your Use of Our Products

Unauthorized access to any part of our products, systems, or networks is prohibited. You may not attempt to breach security measures or interfere with the operation of our products.

Actions that impact the normal functioning of our products or impose undue load on the systems are not allowed.

## Purchase; Additional Terms

Additional terms may apply to the purchase of products or services, and these terms are incorporated into these Terms of Use. Any conflicts between these terms and specific product-related terms will be resolved in favor of the latter.

## Accounts, Passwords, and Security

Certain services may require account creation. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information. Immediate notification is required in case of unauthorized account access.

## Privacy

Our Privacy Policy is integral to these Terms of Use. By using our products, you acknowledge that Internet transmissions are not entirely secure.

## Disclaimer

Our products are provided on an "as is" basis. We do not guarantee error-free, uninterrupted service. We are not liable for any third-party actions related to your use of our products.

## Limitation of Liability

Except as prohibited by law, we shall not be liable for indirect, consequential, or incidental damages. Our liability is limited to the total fees paid in the previous six months or $100.00, whichever is greater.

We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or terminate product operations at any time without prior notice.

These terms are subject to change, and any revisions are effective immediately.

### Indemnification

By using our products, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless me, my officers, directors, shareholders, predecessors, successors in interest, employees, agents, subsidiaries, and affiliates from any losses, liabilities, claims, expenses (including attorneys' fees), or requests made by third parties arising from or related to your use of our products.

## Violation of Terms of Use

If there are any suspicions or complaints regarding your use of our products that may potentially harm or infringe upon my rights/property or the rights/property of other users, I reserve the right to disclose any information about you as required by law or deemed necessary. This disclosure may occur to comply with legal processes, regulations, or governmental requests. I may also disclose your information to prevent fraud or protect the rights, property, or safety of myself, my employees, users, visitors, or the public.

You acknowledge that I may retain any communications you have with me through our products and disclose such information if necessary to:

1. Follow legal procedures;
2. Enforce these Terms of Use;
3. Respond to claims of rights infringement;
4. Safeguard the rights, property, or safety of myself, my employees, users, or the public.

You agree that if I suspect a violation of these Terms of Use, I may, at my discretion, terminate your access to our products without prior notice. You also agree that any violation of these Terms of Use will be considered unfair business practice, and I may seek appropriate remedies beyond monetary damages. This indemnity is supplementary to any other remedies available to me under law or equity.

Furthermore, I reserve the right to terminate your access to our products without prior notice for reasons including but not limited to:

1. Requests from legal authorities or government agencies;
2. Account deletion upon your request;
3. Termination or significant modification of our products or services;
4. Unexpected technical issues.

If legal action is taken against you for violating these Terms of Use, you agree to reimburse all reasonable attorneys' fees and litigation costs in addition to any other legal remedies available to me. I shall not be liable to you or any third party for terminating your access to our products due to violations of these Terms of Use.

## Governing Law; Dispute Resolution

All matters related to your use of our products, including disputes, shall be governed by local laws without regard to conflicting provisions. You consent to the jurisdiction of local courts and waive any objections to such jurisdiction or venue. If you are an EU consumer, you may file claims in your country/region. Any claims under these Terms of Use must be filed within one year, except under separate purchase terms. The prevailing party may recover costs and attorneys' fees. In case of disputes, both parties shall attempt to resolve them in good faith. Mediation may be sought if no resolution is reached within a reasonable time.

## Void where Prohibited

While our products are accessible globally, not all features, products, or services may be available to all users due to legal restrictions. I reserve the right to limit availability based on geographic areas. Any offerings void where prohibited. If you use our products outside your jurisdiction, you are responsible for compliance with local laws.

## Other

You shall not use our products in violation of any laws, including export regulations. Invalid provisions shall be limited to the minimum extent necessary. These Terms of Use supersede all prior agreements. I reject any counter-offers and retain the right to reject them. Failure to enforce these Terms of Use does not waive my rights. These Terms of Use do not confer rights or remedies on third parties.
