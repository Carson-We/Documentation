Fortunate it is that yearning's soundless grace,
For else, its deafening noise we'd have to face.
Silent whispers of longing paint the air,
A gentle breeze, a melody beyond compare.

For if the echoes of longing were too loud,
They'd drown the senses beneath a heavy shroud.
A cacophony of longing's desperate plea,
A tumultuous storm, overwhelming thee.

But hushed and subtle, thoughts of you do roam,
A gentle hum that finds its way back home.
In quiet moments, the heart softly weeps,
A tender symphony that silently seeps.

So let the silence of longing be our guide,
A refuge where emotions softly reside.
For in the quietude, love's whispers abide,
A gentle solace where hearts can confide.
