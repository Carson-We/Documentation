In silence I bear an unspoken tongue,
No willing ear to lend an ear to me,
My voice unheard, my words remain unsung,
A lonely soul longing for empathy.
Oh, let thy heart be open to my plea,
And grant me solace in your gentle ear,
For in your listening, I may be free,
To share the thoughts and feelings held so dear.
Yet, in this silence, I find strength and grace,
For often words do fail to truly speak,
And in the quiet, I embrace my space,
Where inner thoughts and dreams find solace meek.
Though voiceless I may be, my heart still cries,
Hoping one day, my words will reach the skies.
