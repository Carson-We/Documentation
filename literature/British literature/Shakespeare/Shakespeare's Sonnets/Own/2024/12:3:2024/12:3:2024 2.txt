In this age, hand-written letters wane,
Neglected, their significance plain.
No longer treasured, stored in drawers,
Romantic words read by so few.

Penmanship's art, once held high,
Lost in screens, a fading sigh.
Heartfelt words, penned with care,
Replaced by texts, cold and bare.

No value given, writer's efforts unseen,
Emotions lost in a digital routine.
Reader too busy, love's plea missed,
Meaning fades, connections dismissed.

Oh, what a pity, letters fade away,
Society forgets, their worth astray.
Cherished no more, writer's heart breaks,
Passion forsaken, for love's sake.
