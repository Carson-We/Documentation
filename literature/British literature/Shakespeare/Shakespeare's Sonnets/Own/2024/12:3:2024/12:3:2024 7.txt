Oh, the art of handwritten letters fair,
Forgotten by time like mist in the air.
In this digital age, words swiftly fly,
Penmanship's charm but a fleeting sigh.

The writer, imbued with emotions deep,
Crafts heartfelt verses, secrets to keep.
Yet, alas, the world fails to cherish,
The beauty of script, its essence to relish.

Letters penned, a romantic endeavor,
Lost amidst the clamor, lost forever.
No longer revered, their magic unseen,
The art of handwriting, a bygone scene.
