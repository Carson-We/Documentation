When twilight's veil adorns the sky with grace,
And stars, like diamonds, twinkle high above,
In joyous mirth, Kristy finds her own space,
Embracing love and blessings sent with love.

At nine o'clock, as darkness softly falls,
She gathers 'round with dear ones by her side,
With hearts aglow, they share their laughter's calls,
In unity, their spirits do abide.

May peace and harmony reside within,
As Kristy's home is filled with warmth and cheer,
On this blessed eve, let gladness begin,
And grace her heart with love throughout the year.
