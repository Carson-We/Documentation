What lacked in me, that made you turn away,
Departing without a glance, no words to say?
In search of flaws, my heart does deeply ponder,
To fathom why our love could not grow fonder.

Was it my faults, my shortcomings untold,
That caused your heart to wander, to grow cold?
I question what in me failed to ignite,
The fire of love that once burned bright.

Yet answers elude, like whispers in the wind,
Leaving me to wonder, lost and chagrined.
For love's departure, a bitter pill to swallow,
Leaving me with questions, in anguish hollow.

But know, my love, I strive to understand,
In hopes that healing shall come hand in hand.
Though you departed, never looking back,
I'll seek within, mend the pieces that crack.
