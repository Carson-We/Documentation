In noble plight, when others summoned aid,
I lent my hand, their troubles to allay.
Yet when my own dark hour came, dismayed,
No helping soul would come, no light would stay.

Alas, this world, a stage of shifting scenes,
Where kindness fades when shadows dim the light.
The weary heart, consumed by grief's routines,
Finds solace scarce, in depths of darkest night.

For what is friendship but a fleeting flame,
That flickers bright and then is gone, amiss?
In times of need, it proves an empty name,
A hollow promise, void of warmth and bliss.

But still, I'll bear this burden on my own,
And learn the worth of self-reliance true.
For in adversity, my strength is sown,
And from my trials, resilience will accrue.

So let me be the one who lends a hand,
Though none may come to aid me in return.
For in the giving, I shall understand,
The depths of grace, and lessons I shall learn.

In this grand stage, where human frailties dwell,
I'll play my part, with courage, come what may.
And though no help may come, I'll bid farewell,
To expectations, and forge my own pathway.
