Thou sayest I am vexing, thou sayest so,
Yet in the past thou claimed I was unique,
And thou didst block me, leaving me in woe.

In these long days, I'm lost in thoughts so bleak,
Nostalgia floods my mind like surging tide,
I cannot break free, memories I seek.

I reminisce the days we laughed and cried,
Each detail lingers, shadows in my mind,
We were carefree, forever side by side.

Sharing our lives, futures we'd hoped to find,
But fate tore us apart, with no remorse,
Now only memories are left behind.

When I see pictures of our shared discourse,
Tears well up, laughter in school so pure,
Now just memories, no longer the source.

I remember places we'd often tour,
Secrets shared and holidays we'd partake,
Longing weighs heavy, making my heart sore.

Loneliness grips me, its hold hard to break,
Each thought of you, a blade within my soul,
But friendship's bond, time and distance won't shake.

Though pain of longing takes its heavy toll,
I believe it shall pass, this I hold true,
In these long days, I'm lost in the black hole.

Longing, a venomous snake, constrains through,
Our carefree laughter now hollow and cold,
Seeking solace, details bring naught but rue.

Once we relied on each other to hold,
Sharing our lives, but now I face this dark,
Gazing at places, warmth no longer bold.

Longing, a sharp blade, leaves its lasting mark,
Each pang of pain takes my breath away,
No matter the distance, time won't disembark.

The weight of loneliness makes it hard to stay,
Abandoned in this cold and desolate land,
Searching for hope, finding naught but dismay.

I try to find solace, but darkness expands,
I know this negativity won't persist,
Yet now it engulfs me, binds me with its hands.

Helpless and hopeless, future in the mist,
Uncertain if I possess strength to face,
Enduring silently, longing to resist.

Hoping one day this pain will find its trace,
And leave behind a glimmer of hope's light.
