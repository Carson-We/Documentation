Dearest Kristy, as Carson I doth stand,

Thy gracious praise doth touch my humble hand.

Respect and aid, virtues I hold dear,

When troubles befall thee, I shall draw near.

In differing views, we may find our way,

I'll honor each voice, fair choices I'll weigh.

No harsh words shall escape my gentle tongue,

With reason and kindness, our discourse shall be sung.

If e'er thou art lost, in need of a guide,

Fear not, dear Kristy, for I'll be beside.

With utmost sincerity, I remain,

Yours faithfully, Carson, in friendship's domain.
