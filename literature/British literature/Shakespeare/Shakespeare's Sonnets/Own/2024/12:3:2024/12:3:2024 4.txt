Hand-written letters wane, love's art declines,
Neglected, forgotten, lost in modern times.
Few read the inked words, the writer's heart,
Meaning obscured, connections torn apart.

Penmanship fades, screens take center stage,
Emotions diluted, trapped in a digital cage.
Texts replace the beauty, the heartfelt prose,
Romantic gestures lost, as technology grows.

Oh, the pity of letters, their value dismissed,
Society moves on, their significance dismissed.
Writer's longing ignored, passion left to fray,
Hand-written letters fade, love's voice in decay.
