When tempests rage and skies with anger weep,
And thunder's voice does shake the firmament,
I gaze upon the storm that will not sleep,
And feel the weight of sorrow's heavy bent.

The lightning's flash does mirror in my eyes,
The turmoil of a soul that seeks to find,
A kindred spirit who can hear my cries,
And read the storm that brews within my mind.

For in this deluge, I am all alone,
No shelter from the rain, no warmth, no light,
I yearn for one who'll see the seeds I've sown,
And understand my plight against the night.

Though nature's wrath may howl and skies may frown,
I seek a heart to share this weathered crown.
