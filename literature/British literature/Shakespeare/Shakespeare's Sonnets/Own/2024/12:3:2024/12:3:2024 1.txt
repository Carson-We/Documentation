In this modern age, hand-written letters wane,
Neglected by many, their significance plain.
No longer treasured, they gather dust in drawers,
Written by romantics, but read by so few.

The art of penmanship, once held in esteem,
Now lost in a world of screens, a fading dream.
The heartfelt words, once penned with care,
Now replaced by texts and emails, cold and bare.

No longer valued, the writer's efforts go unseen,
Emotions lost in a digital routine.
The reader, too busy, fails to grasp the love's plea,
Missing the depth of meaning, as it fades into decree.

Oh, what a pity that hand-written letters fade,
As society moves on, forgetting their trade.
No longer cherished, the writer's heart breaks,
For their artistry and passion, the world forsakes.
