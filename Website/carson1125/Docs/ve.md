1. **Software Version Stages:**
   - Development Version (Alpha):
      This version indicates that the software is in the early stages of development, focusing primarily on implementing software features. It is usually used internally by the software developers. This version may have more errors and defects that need further refinement.
      
   - Testing Version (Beta):
      Compared to the Alpha version, the Beta version has significant improvements and resolves major errors. However, it may still have some defects that require testing and feedback for further improvement.
      
   - Release Candidate (RC) Version:
      The RC version is an important stage following the Beta version, indicating that the software has entered the final testing phase and may become a candidate for the official release. At this stage, the software usually eliminates most known errors and defects and meets the expected functionality and quality requirements.
      
   - Stable Version:
      This version indicates that the software has become relatively stable, with most errors and defects fixed. However, there may still be a few minor issues present.
      
   - Release Version:
      This version represents the final release, having undergone comprehensive testing and verification, and is ready for normal user use.

2. **Version Numbering and Naming Guidelines:**
   - The software version number consists of five parts: the major version number, the minor version number, the stage version number, the revision version number, and the build number. For example: v1.1.5.0(001).
   
   - Major Version Number (1):
      Increase the major version number when there are significant functional changes or architectural adjustments in the software.
       
   - Minor Version Number (1):
      Increase the minor version number when there are feature additions or modifications in the software.
       
   - Stage Version Number (1):
      Generally used for bug fixes, performance improvements, or minor changes. Increment the stage version number.
       
   - Revision Version Number (1):
      Generally used for bug fixes, performance improvements, or minor changes. Increment the revision version number.
       
   - Build Number (001):
      Used to represent the specific build or release of the software. Increment the build number for each new build.

3. The software version number consists of three parts: the major version number, the minor version number, and the stage version number. For example: v1.1.5.0(001).
   - Major Version Number (1):
      Increment the major version number when there are significant functional changes or architectural adjustments in the software.
      
   - Minor Version Number (1):
      Increment the minor version number when there are feature additions or modifications in the software.
      
   - Stage Version Number (1):
      Generally used for bug fixes, performance improvements, or minor changes. Increment the stage version number.
