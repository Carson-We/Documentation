When midnight hour commands the world's delight,
And hallowed bells ring out a joyful chime,
Kristy's heart aglow, in radiant light,
Embracing Christmas' magic for all time.

As clocks strike twelve, celestial choir's voice,
Rejoices in the birth of love divine,
With open arms, Kristy does rejoice,
In holy blessings that forever shine.

May Christmas' grace unfold in gentle grace,
As Kristy celebrates this sacred morn,
In reverence, her soul finds solace's trace,
And peace, like angel's wings, is gently borne.
