Upon this day, fair Kristy celebrates,
A joyous birth, a moment to rejoice,
Let not thy heart be clouded by dark weight,
But lift thy spirit with a cheerful voice.

"Emo" be gone, a melancholy state,
Cast off the shadows, let thy laughter ring,
For in thy mirth, true happiness awaits,
A vibrant melody, let it sing.

With every passing year, thy light doth shine,
A beacon bright, inspiring those around,
Thy presence, like a star, so pure, divine,
In every smile, a joy that can astound.

So on this day, dear Kristy, we proclaim,
Be happy, let thy spirit rise and soar,
May blessings shower thee like gentle rain,
And fill thy life with love forevermore.
