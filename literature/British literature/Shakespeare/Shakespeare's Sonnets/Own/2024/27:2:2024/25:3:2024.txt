In love, there lies no realm of choice or will,
Nor fickleness that tires when things turn ill.
It is a gentle force, both brave and kind,
A love that warms the heart and frees the mind.

With steadfastness, we tread a path unknown,
Aware it leads to seeds of love yet sown.
For deep within my soul, countless times moved,
A love that whispered, stirred, and gently proved.

This love, not fleeting, but rooted deep within,
An emotion pure, a heart's eternal spin.
It's you, deserving of the love I bear,
A love that stands the test of time and wear.

Though love may seem a choice we cannot make,
Its power, fierce and true, no heart can break.
In resolute devotion, love resides,
A testament to love's enduring tides.
