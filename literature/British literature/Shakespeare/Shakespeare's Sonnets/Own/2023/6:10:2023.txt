In times of grievous woe, no ear attuned,
What sorrow fills my soul, how lonesome, lone!
No soul, no heart, doth lend its heed, immune,
To hear my plaintive voice, my woeful moan.

Like echoes lost amid the barren moor,
My pleas resound, unheard, to empty air,
No solace found in silence's cruel snare,
No kinship forged, no empathy to pour.

Oh, cruel fate! That I must bear this weight,
To carry burdens deep within my core,
While world around me turns a deafened ear.

Yet still, I yearn for one to share my state,
To lend an ear, to feel what I deplore,
To find in human touch a solace sheer.
